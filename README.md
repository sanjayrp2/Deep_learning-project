## About the Project 

Sign LAnguage Translator is a mini-project based on translating the hand gesture of alphabets, designed and developed for Deep Learning course as mini project and also for various competitions and hackathons.  This project Our Sign Language Translator project employs deep learning to seamlessly convert sign language gestures into spoken or written language, promoting accessibility and communication inclusivity.

## Features 

-  **Sign Language Translator** : Incorporates deep learning for precise interpretation, providing a seamless bridge between sign language and spoken or written communication.
-  **Rich Dataset** : Train your models with our extensive collection of hand gesture for alphabets.
-  **Interactive Analysis** : Explore data insights through comprehensive Jupyter notebook visualizations.
